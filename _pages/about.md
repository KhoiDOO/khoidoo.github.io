## Biography 

I am PhD Student at School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. I was sponsored by a research grant titled "Language3D: Creating Editable 3D Content from Deep Language Understanding for 3D-First Digital Platforms" led by [Dr. Binh-Son Hua](https://sonhua.github.io/).

Before taking PhD program, I took my Bachelor Degree on 2024 at Hanoi University of Science and Technology under supervision of [Dr. Viet Dung Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3FN8qi0AAAAJ&hl=en) on a research of Long-tailed Segmetation. My bachelor graduation thesis can be found [here](assets/pdf/thesis/grad.pdf). 

I began my career development as a 3D Software Engineer at ADT Creative when I was in Kim Lien high school. I then changed my career path way to AI in the first year of undergraduation. During that time my research focus on AI-based diagnosis system for health-care application, under supervision of [Dr. Viet Dung Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3FN8qi0AAAAJ&hl=en). From 2022 to 2024, I and my closest collaborators: [Minh Duong Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3ea0RLkAAAAJ&hl=en) had chances to be under supervision of many top-tier researchers: [Prof. Nguyen. H Tran](https://nguyenhoangtran.github.io/), [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/), and [Prof. Quoc-Viet Pham](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/viet.pham/) on Large Batch Traing and Long-tailed Segmentation.
